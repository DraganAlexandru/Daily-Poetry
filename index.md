## **Why reading poetry is good for you?**

Life moves fast, and so do we: answering emails on the train, ordering shopping from the bath or arranging the next social engagement while our companion’s at the bar. Take time out to read a poem, though, and the verse will slow you down naturally. You need to chew the words of a poem over to really make sense of it – skim reading just won’t do. Read the words aloud if you’re alone (or even if you’re not!) and enjoy the feeling of absorbing something that takes a little time to nourish you.

The internet is stuffed with poetry but a lot of the enthusiastic sharers of it make basic errors in transcribing it. A moved word or a missing punctuation mark can hugely change the rhythm or even the meaning, and mar your enjoyment. Reach for a beautiful book instead, safe in the knowledge that the verse hasn’t been mangled on its way to you, and you’re enjoying a holiday from screen time too. 

Poetry isn’t just for leaning on during hard times. It’s a thrill to read a poem that encapsulates – more elegantly than we ever could – how it feels to be deliriously happy, or perfectly tranquil, or deeply in love. It’s one of the reasons that sharing poetry is so popular at weddings.

When I find I’m really about to lose my temper, counting to ten is good – but reciting a silly poem is better (out loud, it has the added benefit of getting the attention of tantrum-throwing children, but in your head is probably better for the platform when your train is delayed.) The poems from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland are my go-to for these times. It’s impossible to grit your teeth while mentally running through ‘You are old, Father William’s perky stanzas.
